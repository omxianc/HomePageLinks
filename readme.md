**Launching HomePageLinks 1.0**

Run the index.html file, and HomePageLinks will open in your web browser. You can set it as your homepage in the browser settings to always have quick access to important links when you start the browser or open a new tab.


**How to add links to the page**

Open index.html with any text editor. Then, edit the links array in it: add your links, remove unnecessary ones. Save this file and refresh the page.


**Notes**

You can add small notes to the page.
Important: Notes are only saved in the browser's local storage. If you move the HomePageLinks folder to another device or open it with a different browser, your notes will not be displayed.
It is strongly recommended not to store passwords or any confidential information in notes.


**Interface**

You can customize the interface parameters of the page (borders, colors, font size, background image) in the css/default-dark-theme.css file. Only change the variable values.
You can also choose other color themes .css, create your own themes, and connect them in index.html, in the section <head>, <!-- interface themes -->
